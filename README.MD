# Pig Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic "Pig" dice game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Rules of the Game

The game can be played by two players. On each turn, a player rolls a single six-sided die as many times as they wish, with each roll added to their turn score. However, if a player rolls a 1, their turn score is reset to 0, and it becomes the other player's turn.

A player can choose to "hold" their turn score, which adds it to their total score and ends their turn. The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game.

# How to Play

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game interface will be displayed, showing the scores of both players and a button to roll the dice.

To start the game, click the "Roll Dice" button. The dice will be rolled, and the result will be displayed on the screen. If the result is a 1, the turn score is reset to 0, and it becomes the other player's turn. Otherwise, the result is added to the turn score.

You can continue rolling the dice as many times as you wish, or choose to "hold" your turn score by clicking the "Hold" button. This will add your turn score to your total score and end your turn.

The game will continue until one player reaches a total score of 100 or more, at which point they will be declared the winner.
